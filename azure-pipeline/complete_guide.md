## Understanding Azure DevOps Pipelines
Azure DevOps pipelines are a powerful feature of the Azure DevOps platform that facilitating the continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of your applications
benefits, including:

Accelerated Software Delivery, Increased Efficiency and Productivity, Consistency and Repeatability, Version Control and Auditing, Flexibility and Extensibility, Continuous Integration (CI):build and test, Continuous Delivery (CD),Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Deployment Orchestration,
## YAML Basics: Syntax and Structure
```bash
Lists:
    - item1

Nested Structures:
    parent:
      child1: value1
      child2: value2
```
## YAML Structure in Azure DevOps Pipelines:
### Trigger
defines the events or conditions that will trigger the execution of your pipeline
```
Trigger:
    trigger:
        branches:
            include:
              - main
              - feature/*
```
### stages
Stages represent the major phases of your CI/CD process.

```bash
stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        # Job configuration goes here

  - stage: Test
    jobs:
      - job: TestJob
        # Job configuration goes here
```
### jobs and steps
Jobs represent the individual units of work within a stage, can run in parallel or sequentially.
Steps define the tasks that need to be executed within a job
```bash
jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
      - script: echo "Building..."
        # Step configuration goes here

  - job: TestJob
    steps:
      - script: echo "Running tests..."
        # Step configuration goes here
```
### Validating and testing YAML Configurations
Before committing and running your Azure DevOps pipeline, it is important to validate the YAML syntax to avoid any unexpected issues during pipeline execution.
